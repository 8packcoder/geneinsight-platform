## ABSTRACT

The **GeneInsight Platform** is a comprehensive Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) bioinformatics application developed to revolutionize genetic analysis and molecular visualization. This project represents a complete commercial-grade platform that combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with advanced 3D molecular rendering capabilities.

Built using modern web technologies including **Next.js 15**, **Spring Boot 3.2**, and **Python Flask**, the platform provides multi-tenant architecture with subscription-based billing, making it suitable for commercial deployment. The application supports comprehensive analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences with real-time 3D structure visualization powered by **3DMol.js**.

Key achievements include successful deployment on **Vercel** with 14 static pages, implementation of JWT-based authentication, integration of machine learning models for sequence analysis, and development of a complete SaaS infrastructure with usage tracking and billing management. The platform demonstrates practical application of bioinformatics algorithms, modern software architecture patterns, and commercial software development practices.

This project was developed during an internship at **Atmohive Biotech, HBTU Kanpur** as a **Full Stack Developer and AI/ML Developer**, showcasing the integration of academic knowledge with industry-standard development practices.

## INTRODUCTION

Bioinformatics has emerged as a critical field at the intersection of biology, computer science, and data analysis. The exponential growth of genomic data requires sophisticated tools for sequence analysis, structure prediction, and molecular visualization. Traditional bioinformatics tools often lack modern user interfaces, scalable architecture, and commercial viability.

The **GeneInsight Platform** addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive SaaS solution that democratizes access to advanced bioinformatics capabilities. Unlike traditional desktop applications, this web-based platform offers:

- **Universal Accessibility**: Browser-based interface accessible from any device
- **Scalable Architecture**: Multi-tenant SaaS design supporting multiple users
- **Advanced Visualization**: Hardware-accelerated 3D molecular rendering
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Machine learning models for enhanced sequence analysis
- **Commercial Viability**: Subscription-based billing with usage tracking

The platform serves researchers, students, and biotechnology professionals by providing an intuitive interface for complex bioinformatics operations, making advanced genetic analysis accessible to users regardless of their technical background.

## LITERATURE REVIEW

The field of bioinformatics software has evolved significantly over the past decades. Traditional tools like **BLAST**, **ClustalW**, and **PyMOL** have been foundational but often require specialized knowledge and local installations.

Recent developments in web-based bioinformatics include platforms like **Galaxy Project** and **Bioconductor**, which provide workflow management and analysis pipelines. However, these platforms often lack modern user interfaces and commercial deployment capabilities.

The emergence of **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** models in biotechnology has created opportunities for more accessible and scalable bioinformatics solutions. Companies like **DNAnexus** and **Seven Bridges** have demonstrated the commercial viability of cloud-based genomics platforms.

**3D molecular visualization** has been revolutionized by web-based libraries like **3DMol.js**, **NGL Viewer**, and **ChemDoodle Web Components**, enabling hardware-accelerated rendering in web browsers without plugin requirements.

**Machine learning applications** in bioinformatics have shown promising results in protein structure prediction (**AlphaFold**), sequence classification, and functional annotation. The integration of ML models into web platforms represents a significant advancement in making AI-powered analysis accessible.

This literature review informed the design decisions for GeneInsight Platform, emphasizing the need for a modern, accessible, and commercially viable bioinformatics solution.
